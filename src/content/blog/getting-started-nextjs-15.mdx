# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building React applications even better. Let's explore what's new and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

### 1. React Server Components (Stable)

React Server Components are now stable and ready for production use. They allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle sent to the client.

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

### 2. Improved Performance

- **Faster builds** with Turbopack (now stable)
- **Better caching** strategies
- **Optimized images** out of the box

### 3. Enhanced Developer Experience

The developer experience has been significantly improved with:

- Better error messages
- Improved TypeScript support
- Enhanced debugging tools

## Creating Your First Next.js 15 App

Let's create a new Next.js 15 application:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

A typical Next.js 15 project looks like this:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
├── next.config.js
└── package.json
```

## Key Concepts

### App Router

The App Router is the recommended way to build Next.js applications:

- **File-based routing**: Files in the `app` directory automatically become routes
- **Layouts**: Share UI between pages with layouts
- **Loading states**: Easy loading UI with `loading.tsx`
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling with `error.tsx`

### Data Fetching

Next.js 15 makes data fetching simple:

```typescript
// Server Component (default)
async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`);
  const data = await post.json();
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices when working with Next.js 15:

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when needed
2. **Optimize images** - Use the `next/image` component
3. **Implement proper caching** - Leverage Next.js caching strategies
4. **Type safety** - Use TypeScript for better developer experience

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a powerful framework that makes building React applications a breeze. With its improved performance, better developer experience, and new features, it's the perfect choice for your next project.

Happy coding! 🎉
