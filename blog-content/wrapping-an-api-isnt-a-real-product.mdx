It’s 2025 and there are already a huge number of LLMs solving problems across every field. From writing and coding to marketing and research, everything has some kind of AI tool available. But the truth is, if you are just taking an existing API and building a small interface around it, that is not really solving a problem. You are only repackaging what already exists and trying to sell it. People can see through that now.

Platforms like ChatGPT have become a part of people’s daily lives, almost as common as using Facebook or YouTube. People have become smarter and more aware. Earlier it was easy to sell software to clients because they did not always know what was possible. But that time is gone. Now everyone knows what AI can do and how to make use of it for themselves.

Developers are the hardest people to sell to. Most of them avoid buying software if they can find a free alternative. They would rather spend hours building or finding something on their own than pay for a product that does not feel worth it. But at the same time, developers are willing to pay for tools that really help them build better, faster or make money. If something adds real value to their work, they will not hesitate to buy it.

That is the key difference today. You cannot just make a simple wrapper and expect people to pay for it. The market is too smart for that. What actually works is when your product makes a real difference. When it helps someone save time, increase output or achieve something they could not before.

*We are living in a time where intelligence is everywhere but true value is still rare. Those who focus on solving problems using AI Agents and Small Language models will be the ones who succeed.*
